## item editor (SQL-raltional DB)

The Python code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for an item editor application. The application allows users to manage and edit items with associated questions and answers. The data is stored and managed using an SQLite database.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing Libraries:
- The code imports necessary modules from the `tkinter`, `ttk`, and `sqlite3` libraries.

Database Class:
- Defines a class called Database that manages the SQLite database and handles operations like creating tables, inserting records, fetching records, updating records, and removing records.

GUI Setup:
- Creates the main GUI window using Tkinter and configures its title, geometry, and background color.

Entry Fields and Labels:
- Defines entry fields and labels for capturing item-related information such as question, options (a, b, c, d), and the correct answer (ans).

Functions:
- Various functions are defined for actions like adding an item, updating an item, deleting an item, clearing input fields, and displaying all items in a Treeview widget.

Treeview Widget:
- A Treeview widget is used to display the items with their respective information in a structured format.

Event Binding:
- Binds a function to the Treeview widget that retrieves the selected item's details and populates the input fields for editing.

Main Loop:
- Initiates the main event loop using `root.mainloop()` to display the GUI and handle user interactions.

Overall, the code sets up a functional interface for managing and editing items in the SQLite database. Users can add, edit, delete, and view items through the GUI.
